# Rubric-Analyser
This project was mentored by Dr. Ed Gehringer and Dr. Pramudianto for Fall 2016. As part of their larger research project, Expertiza, I worked on analyzing peer evaluation rubrics in order to have effective responses from students. This repository contains research findings and the final report.
